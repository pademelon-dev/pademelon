# pademelon
Used to retrospectively add static type checking on legacy project by just
running the checks on only files modified in a pull request. Can be used as a
soft touch approach to bringing a new checking tool into a large project
without one big bang.

Supported checks include:
* `isort`
* `bandit`
* `flake8`
* `pytest` minimum coverage percentage.
* `pyspelling`
